      Terms &amp; Conditions
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you –
      you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app.
      You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks
      in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and
      you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative
      versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other
      intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Journey.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Journey is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible.
      For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its
      services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its
      services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The Journey app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order
      to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app
      secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the
      process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating
      system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious
      programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Journey app
      won’t work properly or at all.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      You should be aware that there are certain things that Journey will not take responsibility
      for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection.
      The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Journey cannot
      take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to
      Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of
      the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be
      charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while
      accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
      responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside
      of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are
      not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we
      assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Along the same lines, Journey cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app
      i.e. you need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you
      can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Journey cannot accept responsibility.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      With respect to Journey’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app,
      it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and
      correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can
      make it available to you. Journey accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you
      experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android and
      iOS – the requirements for both systems (and for any additional systems we decide to extend
      the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you
      want to keep using the app. Journey does not promise that it will always update the app so
      that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS/Android version that you have installed
      on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered
      to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time
      without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any
      termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must
      stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
